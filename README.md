# Contrastive Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

We have developed an unsupervised domain adaptation method which utilizes contrastive learning as a part of our bachelor thesis. We have trained our model on the following datasets:
1. Cityscapes
2. GTAV

Commands to train and run GUI are given below:

#### To train
`bash code\train.sh`

#### To run GUI
* To run model on custom video
`python gui\gui_custom_video.py`
* To run model on available videos
`python interface\gui_available_videos.py`
